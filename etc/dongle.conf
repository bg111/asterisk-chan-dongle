;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------
;jbenable = yes			; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of a
				; Dongle channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
				; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
				; side can not accept jitter. The Dongle channel can't accept jitter,
				; thus an enabled jitterbuffer on the receive Dongle side will always
				; be used if the sending side can create jitter.

;jbforce = no			; Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive side of a Dongle
				; channel. Defaults to "no".

;jbmaxsize = 200		; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

;jbresyncthreshold = 1000	; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
				; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
				; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
				; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

;jbimpl = fixed			; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a Dongle
				; channel. Two implementations are currently available - "fixed"
				; (with size always equals to jbmaxsize) and "adaptive" (with
				; variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2). Defaults to fixed.

;jbtargetextra = 40		; This option only affects the jb when 'jbimpl = adaptive' is set.
				; The option represents the number of milliseconds by which the new jitter buffer
				; will pad its size. the default is 40, so without modification, the new
				; jitter buffer will set its size to the jitter value plus 40 milliseconds.
				; increasing this value may help if your network normally has low jitter,
				; but occasionally has spikes.

;jblog = no			; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".

[defaults]
; now you can set here any not required device settings as template
;   sure you can overwrite in any [device] section this default values

context=default			; context for incoming calls
group=0				; calling group
rxgain=0			; increase the incoming volume; may be negative
txgain=0			; increase the outgoint volume; may be negative
autodeletesms=yes		; auto delete incoming sms
resetdongle=yes			; reset dongle during initialization with ATZ command
u2diag=-1			; set ^U2DIAG parameter on device (0 = disable everything except modem function) ; -1 not use ^U2DIAG command
usecallingpres=yes		; use the caller ID presentation or not
callingpres=allowed_passed_screen ; set caller ID presentation		by default use default network settings
disablesms=no			; disable of SMS reading from device when received
				;  chan_dongle has currently a bug with SMS reception. When a SMS gets in during a
				;  call chan_dongle might crash. Enable this option to disable sms reception.
				;  default = no

language=en			; set channel default language
mindtmfgap=45			; minimal interval from end of previews DTMF from begining of next in ms
mindtmfduration=80		; minimal DTMF tone duration in ms
mindtmfinterval=200		; minimal interval between ends of DTMF of same digits in ms

callwaiting=auto		; if 'yes' allow incoming calls waiting; by default use network settings
				; if 'no' waiting calls just ignored
disable=no			; OBSOLETED by initstate: if 'yes' no load this device and just ignore this section

initstate=start			; specified initial state of device, must be one of 'stop' 'start' 'remote'
				;   'remove' same as 'disable=yes'

exten=+1234567890		; exten for start incoming calls, only in case of Subscriber Number not available!, also set to CALLERID(ndid)

dtmf=relax			; control of incoming DTMF detection, possible values:
				;   off	   - off DTMF tones detection, voice data passed to asterisk unaltered
				;              use this value for gateways or if not use DTMF for AVR or inside dialplan
				;   inband - do DTMF tones detection
				;   relax  - like inband but with relaxdtmf option
				;  default is 'relax' by compatibility reason

; dongle required settings
[dongle0]
audio=/dev/ttyUSB1		; tty port for audio connection; 	no default value
data=/dev/ttyUSB2		; tty port for AT commands; 		no default value

; or you can omit both audio and data together and use imei=123456789012345 and/or imsi=123456789012345
;  imei and imsi must contain exactly 15 digits !
;  imei/imsi discovery is available on Linux only
imei=123456789012345
imsi=123456789012345

; if audio and data set together with imei and/or imsi audio and data has precedence
;   you can use both imei and imsi together in this case exact match by imei and imsi required
